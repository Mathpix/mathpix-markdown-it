# January 2026

- Tabular:
  - Added support for LaTeX `itemize` and `enumerate` lists inside table cells.
  - Nested lists now render with correct markers per level.
  - Custom (`\item[X]`) and empty (`\item[]`) markers are preserved.
  - Fixed edge cases with lists mixed with nested tabular, math, and inline formatting.

- Exports:
  - Markdown: list items are separated with `<br>` inside table cells.
  - TSV/CSV: list items are separated by newline characters.
  - Improved export fidelity for tables containing nested lists.

- Parsing:
  - Tabular cells conditionally switch to block parsing when list environments are detected.
  - Prevent nested `.table_tabular` elements from being processed as top-level tables.

- Docs:
  - Detailed implementation notes and test coverage are documented in
    `pr-specs/2026-01-itemize-support-inside-tabular.md`.
