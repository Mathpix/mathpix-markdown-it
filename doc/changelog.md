## [2.0.39] - Optimize tabular parsing performance

- Performance:
  - Rewrote `getSubMath()` from recursive to iterative single-pass algorithm. The old version rebuilt the entire string on every math expression found (O(N×M) complexity). The new version scans once with a global regex, collects segments into an array, and joins at the end.
  - Replaced `mathTable` backing store from `Array` + `findIndex()` to `Map` for O(1) lookups.
  - Added instance-scoped MathJax typeset result cache (`WeakMap<options, Map<displayMode, Map<math, result>>>`) for `inline_math` and `display_math` tokens. Documents with repeated math expressions (e.g. coordinate tables with ~67% duplicates) now skip redundant MathJax calls. Cache is capped at 50,000 entries per display-mode bucket.
  - Cache is cleared at the start of every full `md.parse()` via a new `reset_typeset_cache` core ruler hook. Partial re-renders preserve the cache. The hook checks `renderElement` at runtime, not at registration time.
  - Cache exclusions: `equation_math`/`equation_math_not_number` (numbering side effects), `inline_mathML`/`display_mathML` (different MathJax path), `return_asciimath` tokens (ascii extraction side effects).
  - Rewrote `getMathTableContent()` to use `parts[]` + `join()` instead of repeated slice+concat.
  - Added `typesetCacheSize` option (default 50,000) to control the maximum number of cached MathJax results per display-mode bucket. Set to `0` to disable caching entirely. Configurable via `md.options`, `MathpixMarkdownModel.render()`, or the `<MathpixMarkdown>` React component props.
  - `mathTablePush` now accepts both `(id, content)` and `({id, content})` forms (backward-compatible overload).

- Benchmark (3.9 MB MMD document with 165 tabulars and 60K math expressions):
  - Parse time: 158s → 16.8s (9.4× faster)
  - Heap usage: 5.7 GB → 367 MB (15.5× less)

  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-04-optimize-tabular-parsing.md`.

## [2.0.38] - Fix infinite loop in `inlineMmdIcon` and `inlineDiagbox` silent mode

- Bug Fix:
  - Fixed page freeze when `\icon{...}` or `\diagbox{...}` appeared inside link labels (e.g. `[\icon{unknown}]`). The inline rules returned `true` in silent mode without advancing `state.pos`, causing an infinite loop in markdown-it's `parseLinkLabel` → `skipToken`.

- Refactoring:
  - `inlineMmdIcon` and `inlineDiagbox` refactored to follow the `if (!silent) { ... } state.pos = endPos; return true;` pattern used by all other inline rules.
  - `mmd-icon.ts`: extracted `endPos` constant, eliminated 6 duplicated position assignments.
  - `diagbox-inline.ts`: moved `extractNextBraceContent` before the silent check so `endIndex` is available in both modes.

- Tests:
  - Added 4 test cases for icon and diagbox inside link labels and bare brackets.

- Docs:
  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-03-fix-silent-mode-state-pos.md`.

## [2.0.37] - CSS scoping and style module cleanup

- CSS Scoping:
  - All MMD class selectors now have `#preview-content`/`#setText` scoped variants for specificity boost.
  - Bare selectors preserved as fallback for `markdownToHTML()` (no wrapper).

- Style Architecture:
  - New `buildStyles(opts: StyleBundleOpts)` single CSS builder — all assembly methods delegate here.
  - `MathpixStyle` restructured into 10 composable sub-functions.
  - Color constants extracted into `src/styles/colors.ts`.
  - `halpers.ts` renamed to `helpers.ts`.

- Improvements:
  - `.tabular` now renders consistently regardless of context (standalone vs nested inside a list). Previously, list context could affect table width and font size via cascade. Fixed with explicit `margin: 0 0 1em`, `font-size: inherit`, and other defensive defaults.
  - `useColors=false` now correctly omits blockquote border, table border, and mark background colors.
  - `getMathpixStyle(useColors=false)` now also omits `ContainerStyle` colors (body text, headings, links, captions). Previously `ContainerStyle()` was always called with default colors.

- Bug Fixes:
  - `div.svg-container` child combinator consistency (`>` for both `#preview-content` and `#setText`).
  - `loadMathJax` updates existing `#Mathpix-styles` element instead of skipping.

- Breaking Changes:
  - `scaleEquation` parameter removed from `loadMathJax`, `getMathpixStyleOnly`, `getMathpixStyle`, and `getMathpixMarkdownStyles`. It was never used in CSS output. If you were passing it positionally, shift your arguments. Use `buildStyles(opts)` for a named-parameter alternative.

- Dead Code Removed:
  - `.empty` selector (never generated), `.preview-right` selector (used as id, not class).

- Docs:
  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-03-mmd-css-scoping.md`.

# February 2026

## [2.0.36] - 16 February 2026

- Math Output Format:
  - Added `output_format` option to `TOutputMath` to control which math format is placed in HTML output.
  - `'svg'` (default): Pre-rendered SVG with hidden formats, works offline.
  - `'mathml'`: Native `<math>` elements only, smaller file size, requires client-side rendering.
  - `'latex'`: Raw LaTeX with original delimiters, smaller file size, requires client-side rendering.

- Browser Rendering Script (`auto-render.js`):
  - New browser bundle for client-side math rendering at `es5/browser/auto-render.js`.
  - Renders MathML or LaTeX content to SVG.
  - Generates hidden format elements for context menu compatibility.
  - Configurable accessibility support via `MathpixAccessibilityConfig`:
    - `assistive_mml`: Add `<mjx-assistive-mml>` for screen readers.
    - `include_speech`: Add `aria-label` with speech text.

- Browser Speech Script (`add-speech.js`):
  - New browser bundle for adding speech to already-rendered SVG at `es5/browser/add-speech.js`.
  - Use when SVG was rendered with `assistiveMml: true` but without `sre` (speech).
  - Loads SRE dynamically and adds `aria-label`, `role="math"`, `tabindex` to `mjx-container` elements.
  - Requires `mjx-assistive-mml` to be present in the rendered output.
  - Exposes `window.MathpixSpeech.addSpeechToRenderedMath(container?)`.

- Accessibility:
  - `mjx-assistive-mml` is no longer marked with `aria-hidden="true"` when accessibility options are enabled. Previously, the assistive MathML element was hidden from screen readers even when the user explicitly requested accessibility via `assistiveMml: true` or `sre`. Now, if any accessibility option is set, the MathML content is exposed to assistive technology — either via `aria-labelledby` (pointing to the assistive MML) or via `aria-label` (SRE speech text). This affects both server-side rendering (`addAriaToMathHTML`) and the new browser bundles.

- Fixes:
  - Fixed centering issue for equations with numbering inside `.math-block[data-width="full"]`.

- Docs:
  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-01-html-math-output-options.md`.

## [2.0.35] - 13 February 2026

- Tabular:
  - When `forMD` option is set, `renderTableCellContent` now delegates `image`/`includegraphics` rendering to the caller's render rules instead of hardcoding `![alt](src)`.
  - Added `isTableCell` meta flag on child tokens when `forMD` is set, allowing render rules to escape pipe characters in alt text.
  - Added null-safety for `attrGet('alt')` in the default image rendering path.

- Docs:
  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-02-formd-delegate-image-rendering-in-table-cells.md`.

## [2.0.34] - 7 February 2026

- Table/Figure:
  - Fixed renderer hang when a `\begin{table}` or `\begin{figure}` has a malformed closing tag (e.g. `\end{table>`).
  - `BeginTable` no longer consumes content across multiple table/figure environments when the first is unclosed.

- Lists (inline):
  - Fixed `latexListEnvInline` silent mode to advance `state.pos`, preventing infinite loops in `skipToken` when `\begin{itemize}` or `\begin{enumerate}` appears in inline content.

- Docs:
  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-02-fix-stuck-render-malformed-table-close.md`.

# January 2026

## [2.0.33] - 27 January 2026

- Tabular:
  - Fixed rendering of tabular environments following nested tabular placeholders that expand to lists.
  - Block parsing status is now propagated from nested sub-tabulars to parent cells to preserve line breaks.
  - Centralized block detection logic into `detectLocalBlock()`.

- Docs:
  - Added implementation details in `pr-specs/2026-01-nested-tabular-text-prefix-with-lists.md`.

## [2.0.32] - 21 January 2026

- Tabular:
  - Added support for LaTeX `itemize` and `enumerate` lists inside table cells.
  - Nested lists now render with correct markers per level.
  - Custom (`\item[X]`) and empty (`\item[]`) markers are preserved.
  - Fixed edge cases with lists mixed with nested tabular, math, and inline formatting.

- Exports:
  - Markdown: list items are separated with `<br>` inside table cells.
  - TSV/CSV: list items are separated by newline characters.
  - Improved export fidelity for tables containing nested lists.

- Parsing:
  - Tabular cells conditionally switch to block parsing when list environments are detected.
  - Prevent nested `.table_tabular` elements from being processed as top-level tables.

- Docs:
  - Detailed implementation notes and test coverage are documented in
    `pr-specs/2026-01-itemize-support-inside-tabular.md`.
